# Facebook Page Embed iFrame

The facebook widget builder only outputs a JavaScript Snipped which infiltrates your site with the facebook Javascript. 
Because of that I created this repository. 

So you just include a iFrame like that.

```html
<iframe src="" style="width: 100%;, height: 100%"; border: 0;></iframe>
```
